# Project Progress Status

## Completed Features
- Basic Django application setup
- Docker containerization
- Development environment configuration
- Database integration (PostgreSQL 17.4)

## In Progress
1. Deployment Pipeline Implementation
   - [ ] Project isolation (ledger-dev/ledger-prod)
   - [ ] Safe destructive commands
   - [ ] Automated backup system
   - [ ] CI/CD workflow

2. Production Readiness
   - [ ] TLS configuration
   - [ ] Static files management
   - [ ] Backup/restore verification
   - [ ] Smoke testing

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Daily automated backup | ✔️ | ❌ |
| CI blocks on test/CVE | ✔️ | ❌ |
| PDF processing p95 | ≤ 5s | TBD |
| Restore time | ≤ 5min | TBD |

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - Update compose files with project flags
   - Add guarded make targets
   - Configure backup container

2. **Short-term (2 days)**
   - Set up GitHub Actions
   - Implement CI pipeline
   - Create smoke tests

3. **End of Week**
   - TLS configuration
   - Static files verification
   - Backup/restore testing
   - Production deployment

## Pending Decisions
- S3/cloud storage for backups (iCloud temporary solution)
- Redis implementation timeline
- TLS termination approach

## Known Issues
None critical at present

## Next Release Goals
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Zero-data-loss guarantee
- One-command deployment/rollback
- Comprehensive monitoring
